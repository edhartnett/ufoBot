      "question": "What is a UFO?",
      "answer": "A UFO is an Unidentified Flying Object. It is 'Something seen in the sky (or on the land, or exceptionally in the water, but thought capable of flight) which the witness could not identify and thought sufficiently strange to report to either an official or unofficial investigating body.' A UFO is the stimulus for a UFO report made by a UFO witness. UFO researchers (often called UFOlogists) study UFO reports and witnesses. After careful investigation, about 90% of all UFO reports can be reasonably explained as either natural phenomena or misidentification of normal man-made devices."
